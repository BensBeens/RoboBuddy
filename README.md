# RoboBuddy
Robo companion using RP2040 and other modules.
The plan is to have a robot that is able to change states/faces by reading the accelerometer data. It will have a variety of faces and sounds.
I am first testing the idea on a Raspberry Pi Pico with external modules. Once I finish the prototype I will make the design smaller by making my own PCB with the RP2040.
The software I am using is Thonny for the micropython code and KiCad for the PCB and schematic design.
8/15/2024: I have finished testing it on the pico and have been working on a schematic for the past weeks. I just finished the pcb design and generated the gerber files. I will hopefully begin production soon and see if my pcb works. I will be using JLCPCB.com to make the pcb board.
